            **PLEASE NOTE!** Only fulfilling the requirements above allows you to receive a complete refund under the Money-Back Policy for your last subscription cycle.

        </p>
        <p class="policy-paragraph">
            This Money-Back policy **does not** apply to App Store and Google Play purchases or to subscription renewals.

        <h2 class="section-title">IMPORTANT STATEMENT</h2>
        <p class="policy-paragraph">
            Generally, if you do not meet the conditions of our Money-Back Policy set out above, the fees you have paid are **non-refundable or non-exchangeable** unless otherwise stated herein or as required by applicable law.

        </p>

        <h2 class="section-title">Note for the EU residents:</h2>
        <p class="policy-paragraph">
            If you are an EEA or Switzerland resident, you have the right to withdraw from the agreement for the purchase of digital services without charge and without giving any reason within fourteen (14) days from the date of such agreement conclusion (withdrawal period). The withdrawal right does not apply if the performance of the agreement has begun with your prior express consent and your acknowledgment that you thereby lose your right of withdrawal. However, if you terminate the agreement during the withdrawal period, you have the right to receive a refund proportionate to the provided service. When you make a purchase of a single item of digital content (such as PDF file, video and so on), you expressly agree that such content is made available to you immediately. As a result, you forfeit your right to withdraw and will not be eligible for a refund.
        </p>
        <p class="policy-paragraph notice-box">
            **HEREBY EXPRESSLY CONSENT TO THE IMMEDIATE PERFORMANCE OF THE AGREEMENT AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU WILL LOSE YOUR RIGHT OF WITHDRAWAL FROM THE AGREEMENT ONCE OUR SERVERS VALIDATE YOUR PURCHASE AND THE APPLICABLE PURCHASE IS SUCCESSFULLY DELIVERED TO YOU.**
        </p>
        <p class="policy-paragraph">
            Therefore, you will not be eligible for a refund, unless the digital content or services are defective.
        </p>

        <h2 class="section-title">Note for residents of certain US states:</h2>
        <p class="policy-paragraph">
            If you reside in California or Connecticut and cancel the purchase at any time before midnight of the third business day after the purchase date, we will return the payment you made.
