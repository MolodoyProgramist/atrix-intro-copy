        <h2 class="section-title">1. Price</h2>
        <p class="policy-paragraph">
            The User can purchase a subscription or/and one-time purchase directly on our Website and view the current prices for it. We offer on our Website auto-renewable subscriptions and one-time purchases that give the User regular access to content, services, and premium features.
        </p>
        <p class="policy-paragraph">
            At the end of each subscription period, it will automatically renew until the User cancels it. Please read the prices carefully before starting a trial subscription or purchasing. Prices may not include bank charges payable by the User and taxes applicable in User’s country.
        </p>
        <p class="policy-paragraph">
            We reserve the right to modify or adjust the pricing for subscription plans and one-time purchases from time to time. Any price change applicable to your active subscription will be communicated to you at least thirty (30) days prior to the effective date of the change by email. If you do not agree to the new price, you may cancel your subscription prior to the effective date. Continued use of the Services after the effective date of the price change constitutes acceptance of the amended price.
        </p>

        <h2 class="section-title">2. Free or paid trial period.</h2>
        <p class="policy-paragraph">
            We may offer a free or paid (for a small amount, for instance, $1) trial subscription to the Service for three days. **Unless you cancel it at least 24 hours before the end of the trial period, you will be automatically charged the price indicated on the payment screen for a chosen subscription plan.** Please note that if a trial subscription is offered, this will be explicitly stated on the price screen before checkout. If this is not the case, you will purchase a subscription without a trial period.
        </p>

        <h2 class="section-title">3. Subscription. One-time purchase.</h2>
        <p class="policy-paragraph">
            To place an order, the User must follow the ordering process, which takes place in **3 steps:**
        </p>
        <p class="policy-paragraph step">
            **Step 1: The onboarding/quiz flow.** The User should answer a few questions provided on the Website to get more relevant and precise information about their needs/desires. After that, the User will receive options for the Service they could choose and purchase on the Website.
        </p>
        <p class="policy-paragraph step">
            **Step 2: Choosing the Service and Making a Payment.** Upon performing a short quiz, each User sees a payment screen. The User can pay via card or PayPal after choosing the payment plan. The User is then required to complete their email address and purchase details. When the payment is successful, the User is shown a screen with a personal link to access the App, complemented by short instructions. A summary of all elements linked to the order is sent to the User's email. From the moment the User has confirmed their order by clicking on this button, they are considered to have knowingly accepted the content and conditions of the order, the fact that their order implies a payment obligation on their part, the prices, volumes, characteristics, quantities and delivery times of the Service ordered.
        </p>
        <p class="policy-paragraph step">
            **Step 3: The order is confirmed.** Upon payment, the User also instantly receives an email with the same personal link to access the product and instructions on adding the site to their bookmarks. The User then receives an email indicating all information related to the purchase. The User is responsible for keeping the electronic mail on paper or their device.
        </p>
        <p class="policy-paragraph">
            If the User chooses to make a subscription, they will be prompted to confirm their purchase with the applicable payment provider. Their payment method will be charged at the prices displayed on the Website for the Service they've selected and any sales or similar taxes that may be imposed on their payments.
        </p>
        <p class="policy-paragraph">
            We are not responsible and share no liability for any payment processing errors that may occur when using Third-party platforms (Stripe, PayPal, Etc.) to make a purchase. We recommend you review the terms and conditions of any Third-party platforms before making a purchase.
        </p>
        <p class="policy-paragraph">
            We worry about you and recommend making purchases responsibly and thoughtfully.
        </p>

        <h2 class="section-title">4. Payment method.</h2>
        <p class="policy-paragraph">
            The User authorizes the Company to charge the applicable fees from the User's Payment Method. The payment will be charged to the payment method specified by the User at the time of purchase during the purchase confirmation (entering the payment method on the web or otherwise accepting the subscription terms or/and one-time purchase stated on the Website) or after the expiration of the trial period.
        </p>

        <h2 class="section-title">5. Cancellation.</h2>
        <p class="policy-paragraph">
            The subscription renews automatically at the end of each period at the cost of the chosen package until the User cancels it. **Please note that deleting the App does not cancel subscriptions.** To avoid being charged, you must affirmatively request subscription cancellation at least **24 hours before the end of the trial or the then-current subscription period.**
        </p>
        <p class="policy-paragraph">
            To cancel the subscription, please follow the instructions at <a href="https://quiz.atrix.guide/terminate">https://quiz.atrix.guide/terminate</a>. In this case, the subscription will be stopped automatically after the User has submitted the form. The User may send us a subscription cancellation request at least 24 hours before the end of the trial or purchased subscription plan’s duration. We will consider the User’s request, after which the User will receive instructions on canceling the subscription to avoid future charges. After that, the subscription will not be renewed automatically.
        </p>
        <p class="policy-paragraph">
            To cancel the automatic renewal of the subscription, please, change the subscription settings of the Account and follow the instructions at <a href="https://quiz.atrix.guide/terminate">https://quiz.atrix.guide/terminate</a>. After the subscription ends, the Service as a whole or its additional content will be available only if a new Subscription is purchased. The User must cancel the automatic renewal of their subscription to avoid being charged the cost of the new subscription.
        </p>
        <p class="policy-paragraph notice-box">
            **PLEASE NOTE!** The purchase of the subscription on the Website does not lead to the User being able to manage it on the App Store or Google Play.
