        <h2 class="section-title">Subscription. One-time purchase.</h2>
        <p class="policy-paragraph">
            The current prices for our Services can be found on our website.We may offer services through our website, Apple Store and Google Play, or other third-party payment platforms (collectively **"Third-party platforms"**) authorized by the Service.You may purchase a Subscription or make a one-time purchase directly from the Company, in which case it is the Company and the external payment service providers (Stripe, PayPal, Etc.) that collect money.
        </p>
        <p class="policy-paragraph">
            To place an order, the User must follow the ordering process, which takes place in 3 steps:
        </p>
        <p class="policy-paragraph step">
            **Step 1: The onboarding/quiz flow.** The User should answer a few questions provided on the website to get more relevant and precise information about their needs/desires. After that, the User will receive options for the Service they could choose and purchase on the website.
        </p>
        <p class="policy-paragraph step">
            **Step 2: Choosing the Services and Payment.** Upon performing a short quiz, each User sees a subscription screen. The User can pay via card or PayPal after choosing the subscription plan. The User is then required to complete their email address and purchase details. When the payment is successful, a user is shown a screen with the personal link to access the App and short instructions. A summary of all elements linked to the order is sent to the User's email. From the moment the User has confirmed their order by clicking on this button, they are considered to have knowingly accepted the content and conditions of the order, the fact that their order implies a payment obligation on their part, the prices, volumes, characteristics, quantities and delivery times of the Services ordered.
        </p>
        <p class="policy-paragraph step">
            **Step 3: The order is confirmed.** Upon payment, a user also instantly receives an email with the same personal link to access the product and instructions on adding the site to their bookmarks and terminating their subscription (via contacting our Support Team or via the link). The User then receives an email indicating all information related to the purchase. The User is responsible for keeping the electronic mail on paper or computer.

        <h2 class="section-title">Governing Law.</h2>
        <p class="policy-paragraph">
            **Cyprus law** will govern this Agreement and any claim, cause of action, or dispute between us concerning the Service, content appearing thereon, or any other matter without regard to conflict of law provisions. For any claim brought by either party relating to or not governed by the arbitration provision of these Terms of Use, the parties agree to submit and consent to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction in, and the exclusive venue of courts located within the laws of the **Republic of Cyprus.**
        </p>
        <p class="policy-paragraph">
            Unless prohibited by law, you agree that any future claims you may have must be resolved through **confidential arbitration, which will be final and binding.** By agreeing to this provision, you acknowledge and accept that you are waiving your right to a trial by jury. It's important to note that the rights you would have in court, such as the ability to engage in discovery or the right to appeal, may be more limited or nonexistent in the arbitration process. You agree that any claim you bring will be on an **individual basis and not as part of a class or representative proceeding.** Furthermore, you acknowledge that the arbitrator is not authorized to consolidate proceedings, claims, or preside over any form of representative or class action. Both you and the Company, along with their respective agents, corporate parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, agree to arbitration (except for matters that may be handled in small claims court) as the sole method of resolving any disputes or claims arising from this agreement, the service, or the privacy policy. This exclusivity applies unless you are located in a jurisdiction that prohibits the sole use of arbitration for dispute resolution.
